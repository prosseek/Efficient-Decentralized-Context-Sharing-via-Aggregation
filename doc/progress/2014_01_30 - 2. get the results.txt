## Goal

Now, we have the results from `massiveSimulate.py` for the case mesh10* files in testSampleDirectory.  

    pattern = os.path.join(testSampleDirectory, "mesh10*.txt")
    a,s,c = runMassiveSimulation(pattern, singleOnly=False)
    print a
    print s
    print c

The result is a/s/c (accuracy, speed, count)

	10.0,9.6,4.0,2.0
	3.0
	66.0,94.0
	
I need to get the values, and I need to process these values to make Excel spread sheets. 


## Action Items

1. Create all the patterns
